## Welcome to the home of the Fast Calorimeter Simulation Challenge 2022!

<!-- ![img](Banner_grey.jpg) -->

This is the homepage for the Fast Calorimeter Simulation Data Challenge. The purpose of this challenge is to spur the development and benchmarking of fast and high-fidelity calorimeter shower generation. Currently, generating calorimeter showers of elementary particles (electrons, photons, pions, ...) using GEANT4 is a major computational bottleneck at the LHC, and it is forecast to overwhelm the computing budget of the LHC in the near future. Therefore there is an urgent need to develop GEANT4 emulators that are both fast (computationally lightweight) and accurate. It is expected that participants will make use of cutting-edge techniques in generative modeling with deep learning, e.g.\ GANs, VAEs and normalizing flows. 


This challenge is modeled after previous, highly successful data challenges in HEP -- the top tagging community challenge and the LHC Olympics 2020 anomaly detection challenge [LINKS]. 

Datasets

We expect to release up to three datasets during the course of the challenge, ranging in difficulty from ``easy" to "medium" to "hard". The difficulty is set by the dimensionality of the calorimeter showers (the number layers and the number of voxels in each layer).

Dataset 1: The ATLAS GEANT4 open dataset [link]. [Describe setup, dimensionality, eta range, particles, ECAL and HCAL, ...]

Dataset 2: TBD

Dataset 3: TBD

Metrics

Participants will be scored using a variety of metrics. These will include a binary classifier trained on ``truth" GEANT4 vs.\ generated shower images, a binary classifier trained on a set of high level features (layer energies, shower shape variables), and metrics derived from histogram differences and chi-squared type measures. Finally, methods will be judged based on their training time, calorimeter shower generation time and memory usage. It is expected that there will not necessarily be a single clear winner, but different methods will have their pros and cons. A link to the full set of metrics will be provided here [link] 

Timeline

The challenge will conclude approximately 1 month before the next ML4Jets conference (currently tentatively scheduled for the week of December 5, 2022). Results of the challenge will be presented at ML4Jets, and the challenge will culminate in a community paper documenting the various approaches and their outcomes. 

Please do not hesitate to ask questions: we will use the [ML4Jets slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/ml4jets/shared_invite/enQtNDc4MjAzODE0NDIyLTU0MGIxNmZlY2E4MzY2YzEwNGI2MGI5MzJmMzEwODVjYWY4MDFhMzcyODYyMDViZTY4MTg2MWM2N2Y1YjBhOWM) to discuss technical questions related to this challenge. You are also encouraged to sign up for the mailing list [GOOGLE GROUP]
for infrequent announcements and communications.

Good luck!
